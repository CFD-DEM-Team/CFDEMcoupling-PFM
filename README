Description
    This code is designed to realize coupled CFD-DEM simulations using LIGGGHTS
    and OpenFOAM. Note: this code is not part of OpenFOAM (see DISCLAIMER).
\*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


CFDEM coupling provides an open source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework 
combining the strengths of LIGGGHTS DEM code and the Open Source 
CFD package OpenFOAM(R)(*). The CFDEMcoupling toolbox allows to expand 
standard CFD solvers of OpenFOAM(R)(*) to include a coupling to the DEM 
code LIGGGHTS. In this toolbox the particle representation within the 
CFD solver is organized by "cloud" classes. Key functionalities are organised 
in sub-models (e.g. force models, data exchange models, etc.) which can easily 
be selected and combined by dictionary settings.

The coupled solvers run fully parallel on distributed-memory clusters. 

Features are:

- its modular approach allows users to easily implement new models
- its MPI parallelization enables to use it for large scale problems
- the "forum"_lws on CFD-DEM gives the possibility to exchange with other 
  users / developers
- the use of GIT allows to easily update to the latest version
- basic documentation is provided

The file structure:

- "src" directory including the source files of the coupling toolbox and models
- "applications" directory including the solver files for coupled CFD-DEM simulations
- "doc" directory including the documentation of CFDEMcoupling
- "tutorials" directory including basic tutorial cases showing the functionality



Details on installation are given on the "www.cfdem.com"

The functionality of this CFD-DEM framwork is described via "tutorial cases" showing 
how to use different solvers and models.

CFDEMcoupling stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -
Discrete Element Method (DEM) coupling.

CFDEMcoupling is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the 
GNU Public License (GPL).

Core development of CFDEMcoupling is done by 
Christoph Goniva and Christoph Kloss, both at DCS Computing GmbH, 2012
