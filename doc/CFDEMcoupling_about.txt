1. About CFDEMcoupling :link(1_1),h3

CFDEMcoupling provides an open-source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework
combining the strengths of the "LIGGGHTS"_lig DEM code and the Open Source CFD
package "OpenFOAM(R)(*)"_of. The CFDEMcoupling toolbox allows to expand standard
CFD solvers of "OpenFOAM(R)(*)"_of to include a coupling to the DEM code
"LIGGGHTS"_lig. In this toolbox the particle representation within the CFD
solver is organized by "cloud" classes. Key functionalities are organised in
sub-models (e.g. force models, data exchange models, etc.) which can easily be
selected and combined by dictionary settings.

The coupled solvers run fully parallel on distributed-memory clusters. Features
are:

its modular approach allows users to easily implement new models :ulb,l
its MPI parallelization enables to use it for large scale problems :l
the "forum"_lig on CFD-DEM gives the possibility to exchange with other users / developers :l
the use of Git allows to easily update to the latest version :l
basic documentation is provided :l
:ule

The file structure:

{src} directory including the source files of the coupling toolbox and models :ulb,l
{applications} directory including the solver files for coupled CFD-DEM simulations :l
{doc} directory including the documentation of CFDEMcoupling :l
{tutorials} directory including basic tutorial cases showing the functionality  :l
:ule

Details on installation are given on the "CFDEMproject WWW Site"_lig .
The functionality of this CFD-DEM framework is described via "tutorial
cases"_CFDEMcoupling_tutorials.html showing how to use different solvers and
models.

CFDEMcoupling stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Discrete Element
Method (DEM) coupling.
