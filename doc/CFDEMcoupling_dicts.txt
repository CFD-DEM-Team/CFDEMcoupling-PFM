4. Dictionaries :link(1_4),h3

4.1 "couplingProperties" dictionary :link(couplingProperties),h4

[General:]

In the "couplingProperties" dictionary the setup of the coupling routines of the
CFD-DEM simulation are defined.

[Location:] $caseDir/CFD/constant

[Structure:]

The dictionary is divided into two parts, "sub-models & settings" and "sub-model
properties".

In "sub-models & settings" the following routines must be specified:

modelType :ulb,l
couplingInterval :l
voidFractionModel :l
locateModel :l
meshMotionModel :l
regionModel :l
IOModel :l
dataExchangeModel :l
averagingModel :l
forceModels :l
momCoupleModels :l
turbulenceModelType :l
:ule

In "sub-model properties" sub-dictionaries might be defined to specify model
specific parameters.

[Settings:]

Reasonable example settings for the "couplingProperties" dictionary are given in
the tutorial cases.

modelType :pre

"modelType" refers to the formulation of the equations to be solved. Choose "A",
"B" or "Bfull", according to Zhou et al. (2010): "Discrete particle simulation
of particle-fluid flow: model formulations and their applicability", JFM. "A"
requires the use of the force models gradPForce and viscForce, whereas "B"
requires the force model "Archimedes". "Bfull" refers to model type I.

couplingInterval :pre

The coupling interval determines the time passing between two CFD-DEM data
exchanges.

A useful procedure would be:

Set the DEM timestep in the in.xxx file according to the needs of the pure DEM problem. :olb,l
Set the "couplingInterval", which refers to the DEM timesteps. Depending on the problem you will need to have a close (small couplingInterval) or loose coupling. :l
Choose the CFD timestep in the controlDict. It must be equal to or smaller than the coupling time, otherwise you will get the error: "Error - TS bigger than coupling interval!". :l,ole

Example: DEMts=0.00001s, couplingInterval=10 exchange data (=couple) will happen
every 0.0001s.

4.2 "liggghtsCommands" dictionary :link(liggghtsCommands),h4

[General:]

In the "liggghtsCommands" dictionary liggghts commands being executed during a
coupled CFD-DEM simulation are specified.

[Location:] $caseDir/CFD/constant

[Structure:]

The dictionary is divided into two parts, first a list of
"liggghtsCommandModels" is defined, then the settings for each model must be
specified.

[Settings:]

Reasonable example settings for the "liggghtsCommands" dictionary are given in
the tutorial cases.
