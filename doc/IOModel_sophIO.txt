IOModel "sophIO"; :pre

[Description:]

The soph IO-model writes particle positions, velocities, voidfraction, implicit forces, explicit forces , DEM forces and radii to files. the same as for basicIO model. Data is written every write time of the CFD simulation.
Currently paraview can only interpret position, velocity and radius (a port to VTK might help).
