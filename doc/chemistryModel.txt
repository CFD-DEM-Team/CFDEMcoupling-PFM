(
    model_x
    model_y
); :pre

model = name of chemistry model to be applied :ul

[Examples:]

[Description:]

The chemistry model initialized the fields performs calculation of molar fractions and diffusion coefficients of the gaseous reactants at the location of each DEM particle. All models are executed sequentially. These values are used in the DEM calculation of particle reduction models.

[Restrictions:]

None.
