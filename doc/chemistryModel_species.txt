[Examples:]

speciesProps
\{
     ChemistryFile     "$casePath/CFD/constant/foam.inp";
     verbose           false;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The chemistry model performs the calculation of chemical reactional effects
acting on each DEM particle. The species model is the model, where the specified
species fields (from the foam.inp folder) are intialized, and information such
as temperature, density, molar concentration and more importantly the molar
fractions are transferred to DEM side.

[Restrictions:]

none
