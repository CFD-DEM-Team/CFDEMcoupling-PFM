dataExchangeModel_twoWayM2M command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

dataExchangeModel twoWayM2M;
twoWayM2MProps
\{
    liggghtsPath "path";
\}; :pre

{path} = path to the DEM simulation input file :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

dataExchangeModel twoWayM2M;
twoWayM2MProps
\{
    liggghtsPath "../DEM/in.liggghts_init";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The data exchange model performs the data exchange between the DEM code and the CFD code. The twoWayM2M model is a model that can exchange particle properties from DEM to CFD and from CFD to DEM. Data is exchanged via MPI technique using the many to many mapping scheme. The DEM run is executed by the coupling model, via a liggghtsCommandModel object.

[Restrictions:]

Should be used in combination with the turboEngineSearchM2M locate model to achieve best performance!
