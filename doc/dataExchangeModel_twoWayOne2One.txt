dataExchangeModel_twoWayOne2One command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

dataExchangeModel twoWayOne2One;
twoWayOne2OneProps
\{
    liggghtsPath "path";
\}; :pre

{path} = path to the DEM simulation input file :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

dataExchangeModel twoWayOne2One;
twoWayOne2OneProps
\{
    liggghtsPath "../DEM/in.liggghts_init";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The data exchange model performs the data exchange between the DEM code and the CFD code. The twoWayOne2One model is a model that can exchange particle properties from DEM to CFD and from CFD to DEM. Data is exchanged via MPI technique using a more sophisticated mapping scheme than twoWayMPI / all2all and scales much better for large systems and many cores. The DEM run is executed by the coupling model, via a liggghtsCommandModel object.

[Restrictions:]

Must be used in combination with the engineSearchMany2Many locate model! Use the "one2one" cfd datacoupling option in fix couple/cfd in LIGGGHTS!
