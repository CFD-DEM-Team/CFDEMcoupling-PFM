    velFieldName "U";
    densityFieldName "density";
\}; :pre

:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    GidaspowDrag
);
GidaspowDragProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    densityFieldName "rho";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The GidaspowDrag model is a model that calculates the particle based drag force following the correlation of Gidaspow which is a combination of Egrun (1952) and Wen & Yu (1966)  (see Zhu et al. (2007): "Discrete particle simulation of particulate systems: Theoretical developments" ,ChemEngScience).

[Restrictions:]

none.
