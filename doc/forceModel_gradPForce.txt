forceModel_gradPForce command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

forceModels
(
    gradPForce;
);
gradPForceProps
\{
    pFieldName "pressure";
    densityFieldName "density";
    velocityFieldName "U";
    interpolation;
\}; :pre

{pressure} = name of the finite volume fluid pressure field :ulb,l
{density} = name of the finite volume gravity field :l
{U} = name of the finite volume fluid velocity field :l
{interpolation} = flag to use interpolated pressure values (normally off) :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    gradPForce;
);
gradPForceProps
\{
    pFieldName "p";
    densityFieldName "rho";
    velocityFieldName "U";
    interpolation;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The gradPForce model is a model that calculates the particle based pressure gradient force -(grad(p)) * Vparticle (see Zhou et al. (2010): "Discrete particle simulation of particle-fluid flow: model formulations and their applicability" ,JFM).

[Restrictions:]

none.
