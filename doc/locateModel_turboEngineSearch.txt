locateModel_turboEngineSearch command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

locateModel turboEngine;
turboEngineProps
\{
    treeSearch switch1;
\} :pre

{switch1} = switch to use tree search algorithm :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

locateModel turboEngine;
turboEngineProps
\{
    treeSearch true;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The locateModel "turboEngine" locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding to a given position. The algorithm is improved compared to engine search to show better parallel performance.

The turboEngineSearch locate Model can be used with different settings to use different algorithms:

faceDecomp false; treeSearch false;     will execute some geometric (linear) search using the last known cellID :ulb,l
faceDecomp false; treeSearch true;      will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell. (recommended):l
:ule

[Restrictions:] none.
