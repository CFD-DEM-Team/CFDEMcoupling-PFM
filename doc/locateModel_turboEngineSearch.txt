locateModel_turboEngineSearch command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

locateModel turboEngine;
turboEngineProps
\{
    faceDecomp switch1;
    treeSearch switch2;
\} :pre

{switch1} = time to start the averaging (default 0) :ulb,l
{switch2} = names of the finite volume scalar fields to be temporally averaged :l
:ule

[Examples:]

locateModel turboEngine;
turboEngineProps
\{
    faceDecomp false;
    treeSearch false;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The locateModel "turboEngine" locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding to a given position. The algorithm is improved compared to engine search to show better parallel performance.

The turboEngineSearch locate Model can be used with different settings to use different algorithms:

faceDecomp false; treeSearch false;     will execute some geometric (linear) search using the last known cellID (recommended) :ulb,l
faceDecomp false; treeSearch true;      will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell. :l
:ule

[Restrictions:] none.
