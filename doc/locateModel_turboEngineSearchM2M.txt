locateModel_turboEngineM2MSearch command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

locateModel turboEngineM2M;
turboEngineM2MProps
\{
    turboEngineProps
    \{
        treeSearch switch1;
    \}
\} :pre

{switch1} = switch to use tree search algorithm :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

locateModel turboEngineM2M;
turboEngineM2MProps
\{
    turboEngineProps
    \{
        treeSearch false;
    \}
\} :pre

[Description:]

The locateModel "turboEngineM2M" locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding to a given position. The algorithm is improved compared to engine search to show better parallel performance.

The turboEngineM2MSearch locate Model can be used with different settings to use different algorithms:

faceDecomp false; treeSearch false;     will execute some geometric (linear) search using the last known cellID (recommended) :ulb,l
faceDecomp false; treeSearch true;      will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell. :l
:ule

[Restrictions:] This model can only be used with many to many data exchange model!
