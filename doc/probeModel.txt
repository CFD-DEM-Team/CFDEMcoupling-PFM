Use probe model "off" to disable this feature.

myProbeModelProps :pre
\{ :pre

\}; :pre


[Examples:]

See "particleProbe"_probeModel_particleProbe.html

Note: This examples list might not be complete - please check below for the list of force models that can perform particle probing.

[Description:]

The probeModel feature allows to implement various probing features in CFDEM. Currently, only the "particleProbe"_probeModel_particleProbe.html model is implemented, that performs probing of particle forces.

[Restrictions:]

None.

[Default:] none.
