smoothingModel command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

smoothingModel model; :pre

model = name of the smoothingModel to be applied :ul

[Examples:]

smoothingModel off; :pre
smoothingModel  constDiffSmoothing; :pre
smoothingModel  localPSizeDiffSmoothing; :pre

Note: This examples list might not be complete - please look for other models (smoothingModel_XY) in this documentation.

[Description:]

The smoothingModel is the base class for models that smoothen the exchange fields (i.e., voidfraction and the Ksl field in case of implicit force coupling). This is relevant in case one uses a small grid resolution compared to the local particle diameter (or parcel diameter in case one uses a parcel approach).

[Restrictions:] These models are in beta testing.

[Default:] none.
