smoothingModel_constDiffSmoothing command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

smoothingModel constDiffSmoothing;
constDiffSmoothingProps
\{
    lowerLimit number1;
    upperLimit number2;
    smoothingLength lengthScale;
\} :pre

{number1} = scalar fields will be bound to this lower value :ulb,l
{number2} = scalar fields will be bound to this upper value :l
{lengthScale} = length scale over which the exchange fields will be smoothed out :l
:ule

[Examples:]

constDiffSmoothingProps
\{
    lowerLimit 0.1;
    upperLimit 1e10;
    smoothingLength 1500e-6;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The "constDiffSmoothing" model is a basic smoothingModel model which reads a smoothing length scale being used for smoothening the exchange fields (voidfraction, Ksl, f if present). This model can be used for smoothing explicit force coupling fields, as well as implicit fource coupling algorithms
(see solver "cfdemSolverPisoImEx").

[Restrictions:] Should be used for monodisperse cases only. 
Time derivatives of the voidfraction field are calculated incorrectly, so don't use them in your solver when smoothing is applied.
