<H3>voidfractionModel_bigParticleVoidFraction command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.
</P>
<PRE>voidfractionModel bigParticle;
bigParticleProps
{
    maxCellsPerParticle number1;
    alphaMin number2;
    scaleUpVol number3;
    weight number4;
} 
</PRE>
<UL><LI><I>number1</I> = max number of cells covered by a partilce (search will fail when more than <I>number1</I> cells are covered by the particle) 

<LI><I>number2</I> = mininmum limit for voidfraction 

<LI><I>number3</I> = diameter of the particle's representation is artificially increased according to <I>number3</I> * Vparticle, volume remains unaltered! 

<LI><I>number4</I> = scaling of the particle volume to account for porosity or agglomerations.

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The bigParticle voidFraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or it's representation) is bigger than a CFD cell. The voidfraction field is set in those cell whose centres are inside the particle which results in a stairstep representation of the bodies within the mesh (i.e. voidfraction is either 1 (fluid) of zero (solid)). For archiving accurate results, approx. 8 cells per particle diameter are necessary.
</P>
<P>The region of influence of a particle can be increased artificially by "scaleUpVol", which  blows up the particles, but keeps their volume (for voidfraction calculation) constant.
</P>
<P>The particle volume occupied in the CFD domain can be adjusted by the parameter "weight", using Vparticle=dsphere^3*pi/6*weight.
