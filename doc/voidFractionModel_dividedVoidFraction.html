<H3>voidfractionModel_dividedVoidFraction command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<P>Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.
</P>
<PRE>voidfractionModel divided;
dividedProps
{
    alphaMin number1;
    scaleUpVol number2;
} 
</PRE>
<UL><LI><I>number1</I> = mininmum limit for voidfraction 

<LI><I>number2</I> = diameter of the particle's representation is artificially increased according to <I>number2</I> * Vparticle, volume remains unaltered! 


</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>voidfractionModel divided;
dividedProps
{
    alphaMin 0.2;
    scaleUpVol 1.0;
} 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The divided voidFraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or it's representation) is in the size range of a CFD cell. Satellite points are used to divide the particle's volume to the touched cells.
</P>
<P>The region of influence of a particle can be increased artificially by "scaleUpVol", which  blows up the particles, but keeps their volume (for voidfraction calculation) constant.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none.
