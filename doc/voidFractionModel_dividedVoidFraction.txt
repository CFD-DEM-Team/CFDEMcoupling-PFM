voidfractionModel_dividedVoidFraction command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

voidfractionModel divided;
dividedProps
\{
    alphaMin number1;
    scaleUpVol number2;
    interpolation;
\} :pre

{number1} = mininmum limit for voidfraction :ulb,l
{number2} = diameter of the particle's representation is artificially increased according to {number2} * Vparticle, volume remains unaltered! :l
{interpolation} = flag to interpolate voidfraction to particle positions (normally off) :l
:ule

[Examples:]

voidfractionModel divided;
dividedProps
\{
    alphaMin 0.2;
    scaleUpVol 1.0;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The divided voidFraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or it's representation) is in the size range of a CFD cell. Satellite points are used to divide the particle's volume to the touched cells.

The region of influence of a particle can be increased artificially by "scaleUpVol", which  blows up the particles, but keeps their volume (for voidfraction calculation) constant.

[Restrictions:] none.
